## Business Problem
This project focuses on key steps in the Data Analysis process: Cleaning, Transforming, Analyzing, and Visualizing data, using the Coffee Sales dataset, which includes metrics such as Total Sales, Country, Top Customer, Orders, and Slicer filters.

The goal is to demonstrate how to work with real-world datasets by:

• Cleaning the data: removing duplicates and addressing inconsistencies in sales records. 

• Transforming the data: standardizing terminology and creating calculated metrics for deeper insights. 

• Analyzing the data: generating pivot tables to rank top-performing products, customer segments, and sales by country, while implementing slicers for dynamic filtering.

• Visualizing the results: producing charts to showcase total sales, customer trends, order patterns, and regional performance.

This workflow exemplifies essential Data Analysis skills, enabling informed decision-making and strategic growth for the coffee business.

## Lessons Learned and Recommendation

- During this project, I learned the importance of organizing the data analysis workflow using Microsoft Excel. Cleaning the data by removing duplicates and standardizing entries ensured consistency, while transforming the data through calculated fields provided deeper sales insights. Pivot tables proved invaluable for summarizing data, revealing trends like top-performing products, and slicers enabled dynamic filtering for focused analysis. Finally, Excel's charting tools allowed me to create clear, accessible visuals that effectively communicated the findings.

- I recommend continuing to leverage Excel’s powerful features for future projects while exploring advanced formulas and visualization options to enhance analysis. Regularly updating dashboards and tailoring visualizations to stakeholder needs can further support informed, data-driven decision-making.

## Limitation and What Can Be Improved

- Scalability: While Excel is effective for small to medium datasets, working with larger datasets can be challenging due to performance constraints. Exploring specialized tools like Power BI or Tableau could offer improved scalability, dynamic filtering, and more advanced visualization capabilities. Integrating such platforms into future projects would greatly enhance the analytical depth and interactivity of dashboards.
